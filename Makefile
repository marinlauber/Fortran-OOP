# This rule says that the executable md depends on the object files in OBJ
# and that they need to be complied then linked to produce the executable.
#	$@ is the target of the rule
#	$^ is all the dependencies of each rule
#	$< only the first element of the dependencies

# If the comand "make clean" is typed it will work
